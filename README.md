App Overview: Developed an Expense Tracking app that enables users to manage and record their daily expenses efficiently. Users can also view and analyze expenses categorized by different types such as Staff, Travel, Food, and Utility. The app is built using Jetpack Compose, LiveData, Room database, and follows the MVVM architecture for a clean and responsive user experience.
AI Usage Summary: I used ChatGPT and Cursor extensively throughout the development process. They helped generate UI layout ideas, especially for the category section and theme selection. AI tools assisted in creating data model classes, implementing Hilt for dependency injection, understanding project requirements clearly, generate the queries for room database and optimizing the code for better performance and readability.
